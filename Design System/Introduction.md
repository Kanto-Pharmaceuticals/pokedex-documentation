# Introduction

This Design System seeks to replicate a Pokédex user experience in a modernized web format. Many design cues are taken directly from the game and anime series in order to preserve the nostalgic feeling of the IP. This system does not intend to re-invent the wheel, and instead aims to provide a simple, and modern experience to cataloging Pokémon.  
  
At its root, the Pokédex’s core function has been to: database captured Pokémon, provide details on Pokémon encountered, provide a diploma on completion of the Pokédex, track Badge and Item acquisitions, and in recent years, provide the news. In terms of the Visual Design process and how it equates pages, these functions can be mapped to the following main pages:  
  
1. Encyclopedia of all known Pokémon  
2. Encyclopedia of all known Items  
3. Encyclopedia of all known Badges  
4. News content feed  
5. Maps of all known Locations  
6. Trainer Registration/Profile

# Pokedex Documentation

The Documentation for the Pok√©dex uses a Jamstack approach in contrast to the Application itself. It uses Gatsby as the frontend framework without a headless CMS (this is subject to change), GitHub for versioning and deployment, and assumes NGINX for serving.

## Important

This repository was created as submodule of the [Pokedex](https://github.com/Kanto-Pharmaceuticals/pokedex) with the intention of re-using it's code for scaffolding other projects.
